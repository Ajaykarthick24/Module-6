# üêç Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## üéØ AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

## üß† ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

## üíª Program
from abc import ABC
class type_shape(ABC): 
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(type_shape):
    length = 6
    breadth = 4
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle(type_shape):
    radius = 7
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.radius**2
class Square(type_shape):
    length = 4
    def area(self):
        return self.length**2

class triangle(type_shape):
    length = 5
    width = 4
    def area(self):
        return 0.5*self.length*self.width
  
r = Rectangle()
c = Circle() 
s = Square() 
t = triangle() 
print("Area of a rectangle:", r.area())
print("Area of a circle:", c.area()) 
print("Area of a square:", s.area()) 
print("Area of a triangle:", t.area()) 
## Output
<img width="691" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47eff0c3-8ceb-4c83-84d0-731c377d5a46" />

## Result
Thus the program to create an abstract class named Shape with an abstract method calculate_area, and implement this method in two subclasses: Rectangle and Circle is executed successfully.
